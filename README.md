# ine-r-packages-presentation

Presentation made for the National Institute of Statistics of Portugal (INE.pt)
titled "Creating Reusable Code with R Packages".

Repo includes code steps for creating a new package that extends {ggplot2} with
personalized theme for demonstration purposes.

Topic for this presentation in particular and code was inspired by a very fun
project which I found on the internet: [https://github.com/ekholme/blueycolors](https://github.com/ekholme/blueycolors)

A big thank you to everyone at INE for the invite and thoughtful questions.
